            Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.
            Website is a page on internet with a unique URL with informtion.It is a collection of publicly accessible , interlinked Web pages that share a single domain name.
            Websites can be created and maintained by an individual , group , business or organisation to serve a variety of purposes.Together , all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:
            <ul>
                <li>Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.</li>
                <li>Development: Building the application from scratch.</li>
            </ul>
           <br>
           Web Development can be classified into two ways:
           <ol>
            <li>Frontend Development:The part of a website that the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.
            </li>
            <li>Backend Development:Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.</li>
           </ol>
        </p>

                <p>
                    HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

                    CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

                    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

        <h3>HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE(HTML)</h3>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

        <h3>CASCADING STYLE SHEET(CSS)</h3>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.

        <h3>JAVA SCRIPT(JS)</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
